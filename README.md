# snakegame-bny-micro-controller
We use GPIO of STM32F051R8T6 to drive the LCD-00710 to show the snake game and read in the input of four buttons which are used to control the direction of the snake. When the game is playing, we also use DAC of STM32F051R8T6 to drive a 8Î© speaker to play music and a potentialometer to adjust the volume.
